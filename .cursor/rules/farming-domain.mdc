# Farming Domain Knowledge

## Agricultural Terminology (Canterbury, NZ Context)
- **Field/Paddock**: Agricultural land parcel for crop production (paddock is NZ terminology)
- **Yield**: Amount of crop produced per unit area (typically kg/hectare)
- **Irrigation**: Artificial water application to crops (critical in Canterbury's dry climate)
- **Cultivation**: Soil preparation for planting
- **Harvesting**: Gathering mature crops
- **Fertilizer**: Nutrients applied to enhance crop growth (NPK ratios important)
- **Pest Control**: Management of harmful insects/diseases
- **Crop Rotation**: Alternating crops to maintain soil health
- **Pasture**: Grassland for livestock grazing
- **Stock**: Livestock (cattle, sheep common in Canterbury)

## Key Farming Operations
1. **Field Management**: Track crop types, planting dates, growth stages
2. **Equipment Tracking**: Monitor tractors, harvesters, irrigation systems
3. **Task Scheduling**: Planting, spraying, fertilizing, harvesting schedules
4. **Weather Monitoring**: Rainfall, temperature, wind (crucial for Canterbury)
5. **Yield Analytics**: Production data, efficiency metrics
6. **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, environmental standards

## Seasonal Considerations (Southern Hemisphere)
- **Spring (Sep-Nov)**: Planting season, pasture renewal
- **Summer (Dec-Feb)**: Growing season, irrigation critical
- **Autumn (Mar-May)**: Harvesting, soil preparation
- **Winter (Jun-Aug)**: Maintenance, planning, livestock feeding

## Data Types & Measurements
Use these units and formats in [farming.ts](mdc:src/types/farming.ts):
- **Area**: Hectares (ha) - standard in NZ agriculture
- **Yield**: kg/ha, tonnes/ha
- **Rainfall**: mm
- **Temperature**: Celsius
- **Coordinates**: Decimal degrees (latitude/longitude)
- **Dates**: ISO format for consistency

## Common Field Status Types
```typescript
type FieldStatus = 'planted' | 'growing' | 'ready_to_harvest' | 'harvested' | 'fallow' | 'under_irrigation';
type TaskStatus = 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'overdue' | 'cancelled';
type EquipmentStatus = 'operational' | 'maintenance_due' | 'in_repair' | 'out_of_service';
```

## Canterbury-Specific Context
- **Climate**: Semi-arid, irrigation essential
- **Crops**: Wheat, barley, potatoes, vegetables, dairy pasture
- **Challenges**: Water management, nor'west winds, frost risk
- **Regulations**: Environment Canterbury water consents
- **Infrastructure**: Irrigation schemes, rural roads
